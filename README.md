# NodeJS News Bot for Facebook Messenger

###[DEMO](https://www.messenger.com/t/1363604437002370)

There's not too many practical examples out there of Nodejs bots built using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), so here's one. I've tried to leave comments to explain what's going on. 

I will be posting a full tutorial on how to build this from scratch for beginners along with explanations, so look out for updates (or you can follow [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/alyssaong1337)). 

**Feel free to leave feedback. I also take requests for bots! You can tweet me or email me at ongalyssa@outlook.com :)**

##Usage
If you want to run the code yourself, you will need to create a bot on [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and replace the appId and appPassword in the code with your bot's appId and appPassword. You will also need to go and get a Bing Web Search API Subscription Key from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-web-search-api) and set BINGNEWSKEY in the code with your own subscription key.
